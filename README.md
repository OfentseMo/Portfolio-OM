## About me

I am a positive-minded individual with dual strengths. One side of me is organized, structured, and detail-oriented, while the other side thrives on communication and problem-solving.

Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
